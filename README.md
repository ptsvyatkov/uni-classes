Digital media basics (GDM), Image processing (BV), Computer graphics courses (CG) <br>
Those are some of the courses I took during my earlier semesters that included programming exercises listed with the topics included.

### GDM
Introductory class to basics of digital media <br>
- Digital images, Digitisation, Resolution, Antialiasing, Scanning and printing <br>
- Vision and colour, Colour systems <br>
- Image manipulation, Elementary image processing <br>
- Pixel operations, Filters, Retouching, Geometric transformations <br>
- Image montages, Effect filters, Layer techniques, Animation techniques <br>

### BV
Image processing course in which we learned and applied different algorithms <br>
- Filters - Linear filters, Non-linear filters, Detection of edges and contours <br>
- Geometric image transformations - Affine Transformations / Perspective <br>
- Morphological Filters - Basics of signal processing, Level, SNR <br>
- Basics of image compression - DPCM, DCT(JPEG) 

### CG
Computer graphics course in which we used LWJGL (Lightweight Java Game Library) <br>
- Pixel: Computer Graphics = Painting Pixels?
- 2D: Basics, geometry, algorithms
- 3D: Expanding basics, projection
- Light: Colours, illumination models
- Texture: Applications, examples
- Shader: Modern graphics programming
- Worlds: Managing huge amounts of data
- Animation: From straight to complex
- CSG, ray tracing: Idea, advantages/disadvantages
